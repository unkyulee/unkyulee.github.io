            <span class="description">I am proud to showcase my expertise in developing a cutting-edge hardware and
                software ecosystem for Fintel, a prominent client in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. The project
                involved designing and implementing all essential components to construct a Fast DC charger tailored for
                EVs, featuring a highly flexible power configuration spanning from 60 kW to an impressive 320 kW. What
                sets this innovation apart is its colossal display, strategically integrated to showcase advertisements.
                This innovative business model combines advertisement display with charging capabilities, presenting a
                unique and pioneering approach within the EV charging market. This project exemplifies my dedication to
                driving innovation and delivering solutions that transcend traditional boundaries in the electrified
                transportation sector.</span>

            <span class="description">In addition to revolutionizing the electric vehicle (EV) charging landscape, our
                innovation extends to the realm of eBikes. Our integrated ecosystem seamlessly incorporates eBike
                chargers utilizing the same robust infrastructure as the EV chargers. This intuitive system allows users
                to effortlessly pay and plug in to charge their eBikes. Notably, our design boasts a remarkably simple
                setupâ€”merely requiring the addition of a compact box and an internet connection, with no need for
                extensive construction modifications. With the burgeoning installation of power plugs in bicycle
                infrastructures to support long-range eBike journeys, our solution stands as a cost-effective enabler,
                reinforcing sustainable infrastructure for a greener future.</span>

            <span class="description">Our ongoing research project focuses on the development of an in-house module to
                facilitate a bi-directional charging system for Electric Vehicles (EVs). The EV, equipped with a
                formidable 60 kW battery, possesses the capacity to power an average household for up to two weeks
                without requiring a recharge. This breakthrough redefines the conventional perception of a car,
                transforming it into a mobile energy storage unit. Our research aims to unlock this potential and
                harness the concept of EVs as movable energy reservoirs, paving the way for an innovative and
                sustainable approach to energy consumption and distribution</span>
